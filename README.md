# 👷‍♂️ Work In Progress: My GitHub Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a **work in progress** as I build and organize my data analytics portfolio. I’m using this space to document my learning journey, showcase projects, and experiment with new tools and techniques.

## 🚀 About This Portfolio

This repository will evolve over time as I add projects, refine documentation, and align everything with my professional goals in **data analytics**.  
Currently, I’m focusing on:

- 🧮 Building hands-on data analytics projects using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**
- 🗂 Structuring datasets and analysis workflows
- 📊 Practicing data storytelling and visualization
- ⚙️ Establishing version control best practices with **GitHub**

## 📁 Planned Repository Structure

Here’s an outline of what I’m working toward:

- `/projects` → Individual analysis or visualization projects (in progress)
- `/datasets` → Public, cleaned data for learning and practice
- `/scripts` → Reusable code snippets and data prep scripts
- `/notebooks` → Exploratory data analysis and documentation notebooks
- `/docs` → Project notes, guides, and portfolio updates

## 💡 Next Steps

- [ ] Upload initial data cleaning project (Python)
- [ ] Create a Power BI dashboard example
- [ ] Add detailed project READMEs
- [ ] Build a professional GitHub profile README

## 🧠 Current Focus

At the moment, I’m learning and applying:

- SQL querying and database management  
- Python for data wrangling (**pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**)  
- Power BI for interactive reporting  
- Clear communication through data storytelling
